# ML-Guide-using-Scikit-Learn
I tried Scikit Learn for the first time and used different datasets and models to understand Machine Learning

I used seaborn for visualizations and Data Exploratory Analysis.

# The models used are: 

1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression
3. K Nearest Neighbors
4. Support Vector Machines
5. Decision Trees
6. Single Decision Tree
	1. Random Forest
	2. Boosted Trees
	3. Naive Bayes and TF-IDF Vectorizer
7. K_Means Clustering
8. Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN)
9. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

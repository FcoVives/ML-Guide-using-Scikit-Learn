# ML-Guide-using-Scikit-Learn
I use Scikit Learn for the first time and use different datasets and models to understand Machine Learning

I used seaborn for visualizations and Data Exploratory Analysis.

The models used are:
-Linear Regression
-Logistic Regression
-K Nearest Neighbors
-Support Vector Machines
-Decision Trees
  -Single Decision Tree
  -Random Forest
  -Boosted Trees
-Naive Bayes and TF-IDF Vectorizer
-K_Means Clustering
-Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) 
-Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
